# Week Long Data Collection Results

The following results come from data from June 25th, 2018 continuously through July 2nd, 2018. The data was collected from all subreddits from [/r/all](https://www.reddit.com/r/all/), just as the previous data collections have been from. 

The purpose of this is to have a larger sample size to see any interesting data points. There is no comparison data here (the original data collection compared comments from a Monday to comments from a Saturday.

You can see the original data collection results [here](/README.md).

# Results

In one week, I collected approximately 200,000 comments. I believe I actually collected around 202,000 comments, but I truncated the results to an even 200,000.

The full results are available in [here](/data/week%20%286-20%20-%207-2%29/results.txt), but I will go over some of the results here.

Again, [r/AskReddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/) came out on top, with 10,839 comments (~5.42% of the total comments collected total). This is incredibly similar to the other two data collections (they had an average of 5.48% of the total comments coming from [r/AskReddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/)).

See the chart below to see other top subreddits from this data.
