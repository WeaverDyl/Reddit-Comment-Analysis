# Week Long Data Collection Results

The following results come from data from June 25th, 2018 continuously through July 2nd, 2018. The data was collected from all subreddits from [/r/all](https://www.reddit.com/r/all/), just as the previous data collections have been from. 

The purpose of this is to have a larger sample size to see any interesting data points. There is no comparison data here (the original data collection compared comments from a Monday to comments from a Saturday.

You can see the original data collection results [here](/README.md).

# Results

In one week, I collected approximately 200,000 comments. I believe I actually collected around 202,000 comments, but I truncated the results to an even 200,000.

The full results are available in [here](data/week%20(6-25%20-%207-2)/results.txt), but I will go over some of the results here.

Again, [r/AskReddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/) came out on top, with 10,839 comments (~5.42% of the total comments collected total). This is incredibly similar to the other two data collections (they had an average of 5.48% of the total comments coming from [r/AskReddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/)).

Overall, I collected comments from 12,301 (!) subreddits. That's almost 4.5 times the number I collected in my one day trials!

There was, again, some interesting account age data as well. The oldest account was made on July 26th, 2005. The average account was made on October 13th, 2015. Again, the average account age is very similar to the one day trials that were run.

In total, there were 9859 deleted comments, which is about 5% of all comments. from the one day trials, an average of ~4% of comments were deleted for comparison. The subreddits with the most deleted comments can be found below.

After a week, the average comment had a score of just over 9, and an average of ~.5 replies.

# Conclusion

Overall, many of the statistics remained very similar, which kind of surprised me. I was hoping I would see some kind of surprise within the data, but just about everything remained very similar. Even the average comment length remained almost the same (~160 for the one day trials vs 167 for the week long trial). I probably won't run any more trials, just because it takes so long to collect all of the data, but I think with 220,000 unique comments, somebody might be able to do something new with the data if they want.
